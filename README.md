### Purpose of this project

This project is for a university course to demonstrate my knowledge of Java

### What are you looking at here?

This project's requirements were to, using exclusively Java and JavaFX, build out a GUI project that would help the user keep track of appointments.

#### Requirements:

- Use only JavaFX and no external libraries to build out the UI
- Support any timezone the user may log in from 
- Provide various reports on either the user of the tool or the data stored within the associated SQL database
- Be able to register new customers into the tool
- Be able to set up new appointments with a customer
- Allow the user to see all existing appointments
- Alert the user to any appointments that are comming up within 15 minutes of logging into the tool (the log in process is entirely unsecure as the database was pre-made and did not allow for any normal security practices like salting and hashing etc..)
